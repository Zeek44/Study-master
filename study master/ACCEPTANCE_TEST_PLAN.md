## Automated Testing Notes

While this document focuses on manual acceptance testing, the following automated tests should also be implemented:

- Unit tests for utility functions (SRS algorithm, date calculations, etc.)
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Database migration tests
- Authentication flow tests
- Component rendering tests

Run automated tests with: `npm test` (when implemented)

This acceptance test plan ensures that StudyMaster AI meets all production requirements and provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly learning platform.
